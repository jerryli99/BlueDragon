## Frontend Crawler

A specific crawler for scraping news content.

When you visit Microsoft Edge, you will see a lot of news and ads being displayed before you input something for search. That's the front end side. I like this idea and want to do this as well. I make this seperate from the search engine crawler because these are more specific and not general.

I will crawl a few tech news website and then select some article thumbnails to display on the front end.

Sites: [hackernoon.com, wired.com, space.com, dev.to, technologyreview.com, marktechpost.com, quantamagazine.org, bigthink.com]
