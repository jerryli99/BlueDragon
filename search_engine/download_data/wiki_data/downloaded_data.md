## Downloaded Data

I mean if I can just download a lot of data without doing a lot of web scraping, why not?

So, I downloaded the whole Wikipedia (~91 GB as of 08/2023). What will I do with this kind of data? Uhm, I can use it to train my own version of LLM (mini-version) so that I don't need to use ChatGPT for general information. We will see if that makes sense.
